Questions - 

1.What app categories are most popular?

2.How can I maximize user ratings?

3.Which app categories have least competition?

4.Should I keep my app free or paid?

1.Min rating = 0, max = 5, avg = 3.52

2.paid app rating = 3.72 > free app rating = 3.37

3.More than 50% apps are from Games genre (3862).

4.10-30 languages = >4.13 rating, >30 langs = 3.78, <10 langs = 3.37

5.Long description = highest avg rating (3.86)

6.23 apps from 23 genres have 5 star ratings.

Insights - 

1.Paid apps have better ratings. This could be due to number of reasons like users who pay for an app may have an higher engagement and perceived more value leading to the better ratings.

2.Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings. Rather than focusing on the quantity of languages, focus more on right set of languages.

3.Categories like Finance and Book apps have low ratings. This suggests that user needs are not being fully met and so this represent a market opportunity, as if you can create a quality app in these categories that addresses the user needs in better way, there is potential for high user ratings and market penetration.

4.Apps with a longer description have better ratings. This suggests that users appreciate having a clear understanding of the apps' features and capabilities before they download the app. 

5.A new app should aim for an above average rating (above 3.5) to stand out from the crowd.

6.Games and Entertainment category apps have very high competition. However, this also suggest high user demand in this sector.
